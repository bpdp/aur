# AUR Package(s)

My own AUR - Arch User Repository. Some are taken from AUR and then modified, some created by myself. To have the package installed, do this:

```bash
$ cd <dir>
... < do whatever with the source / PKGBUILD / etc >
$ makepkg
$ sudo pacman -U package.zst
```

Inside each directory, you will see any important information related to the package -- or not.
