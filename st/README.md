# st - Terminal Emulator from Suckless

The `config.def.h` is default configuration from st distribution. Just copy this to `config.h` if you don't want to change anything. If you want to change anything, copy to `config.h` then edit. The [config.h](config.h) file here is my configuration. I change the font size and background color:

```bash
$ diff config.def.h config.h
8c8
< static char *font = "Liberation Mono:pixelsize=12:antialias=true:autohint=true";
---
> static char *font = "Liberation Mono:pixelsize=20:antialias=true:autohint=true";
123,124c123,124
<       "gray90", /* default foreground colour */
<       "black", /* default background colour */
---
>   "#2f2c45",
>   "#928FB0",
132,133c132,133
< unsigned int defaultfg = 258;
< unsigned int defaultbg = 259;
---
> unsigned int defaultfg = 259;
> unsigned int defaultbg = 258;
```

## Added Patch

1. [erresc8.patch](erresc8.patch): Fixed error for **erresc: unknown str ESC]8**. See: https://github.com/yaaama/st-mrdotx/commit/0841790cb0773bdac2ba87cb8825350e5e09b4e1. Full description:

```bash
Fix for "erresc: unknown str ESC]8" stderr spam
This is a single line fix for the endless standard stderr IO spam
generated by the fact that st has not implemented the xterm hyperlink
extension.

Some context:
- st does not properly support the hyperlink extension/proposal that some other
xterm based terminal emulators support.
- We currently print an error whenever the specific escape
codes are encountered.
- Due to this, whenever I open a terminal my log files are endlessly
flooded with the message: `erresc: unknown str ESC]8`.

The fix seems to work on multiple different builds of st (I've tested
two so far). I've tested the `siduck/snazzy-terminal` build, and the
`mdrdotx/st` build.

I've been using this patch for two weeks or so and I haven't noticed
any problems so I think it is okay.
